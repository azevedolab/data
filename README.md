# data
Scikit-Learn and the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) were the sources of some of the datasets available here. You will also find datasets used to train machine-learning models to predict binding affinity against protein targets. We employ these datasets for teaching and research purposes. The purpose of datasets containing information about protein-ligand interaction is mainly the development of the following machine-learning tools: SAnDReS (https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres), Taba (https://github.com/azevedolab/taba), and SFSXplorer (https://github.com/azevedolab/SFSXplorer).
